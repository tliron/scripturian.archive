The file jsr223-api.jar was taken from the Phobos CVS repository on March 14 2009:

https://phobos.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/phobos/phobos/lib/jsr223-api.jar

It is distributed under the CDDL 1.0 license used by the entire Glassfish project:

https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/CDDLv1.0.html

It is, as I understand, this jar is simply the source code for the JSR-223 implementation
from JDK 1.6 compiled for JDK 1.5.

Note that the reference implementation available at JCP is only a partial implementation
of the JSR. For reference, it is available here:
