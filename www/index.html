See the <a href="http://threecrickets.com/scripturian/">main site</a>  for more information, live demos and full documentation.</p><p>Releases are available for download <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=10328">here</a> . <br /></p><h3>Features</h3>   <p>Scripturian's central feature is that is provides embedded scripting support for many scripting languages, allowing you to mix plain text and embedded &quot;scriptlets,&quot; in the style of PHP, JSP and ASP. Any application that generates text can make good use of it, at the minimum as a templating solution, but at the maximum as a fully programmatic way to generate text. For example, a blogging or content management application can use it to give users complete control over theming/skinning. </p>       <p>It's not always easy to configure and start arbitrary scripting engines, contexts, etc. Scripturian does it all for you. For example, any file with <span style="font-family: monospace">&lt;%python</span> at the beginning will start the appropriate script engine. It's a straightforward equivalent of the <span style="font-family: monospace">#!/</span> used by shells.</p>       <p>Finally, it provides an easy way to bootstrap Java applications using scripting, by delegating the <span style="font-family: monospace">main()</span> method straight into an embedded script. It makes it easy to quickly make changes in how your applications start up without recompiling it.</p>    <h3>Supported Scripting Languages</h3>    <ul>    <li>JavaScript</li>       <li>PHP<br />    </li>       <li>Python</li>       <li>Ruby</li>       <li>Groovy <br />    </li>    </ul>    <h3>Uses</h3>    <p>The <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a>  framework has an optional extension that uses Scripturian to allow for implementing REST resources in script, generating HTML with embedded scripts, and bootstrapping Restlet components in script. The result is that it's possible to develop very powerful REST applications using only scripting languages, without a single line of Java code, effectively allowing for &quot;Ruby on Restlet&quot;, &quot;Python on Restlet&quot;, etc.</p> <h3>About This Site</h3> <p>This is Scripturian's support and development site, generously hosted by Tigris.</p>  <ul><li>For support, search the <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">forums (called &quot;discussions&quot; on Tigris)</a>  for answers to your questions, or join them and post!</li><li>Help make Scripturian better by <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">reporting bugs (&quot;defects&quot;)</a> <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">  or requesting enhancements</a> .</li><li>Better yet, contribute patches and code yourself!
