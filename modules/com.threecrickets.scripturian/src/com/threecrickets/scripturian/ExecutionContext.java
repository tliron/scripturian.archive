/**
 * Encapsulates context for an {@link Executable}.
 * <p>
 * You should always {@link #release()} an execution context when done using it.
 * <p>
 * An execution context is not in itself thread-safe. However, it supports two
 * use cases with different threading behavior.
 * <p>
 * The first occurs when
 * {@link Executable#execute(ExecutionContext, Object, ExecutionController)} is
 * callable by concurrent threads. In this case, each thread should create
 * <i>its own execution context</i>, and the context in such cases is
 * essentially thread-unique. Just be aware that if your executable spawns
 * threads, they would need to coordinate access to the context if they need it.
 * <p>
 * The second occurs when
 * {@link Executable#makeEnterable(ExecutionContext, Object, ExecutionController)}
 * is called, and then {@link Executable#enter(String, Object...)} is callable
 * by concurrent threads. In this case, <i>all invoking threads share the same
 * execution context</i>. Because the context is immutable (internally
 * {@link #makeImmutable()} is called), it is "thread-safe" to the extent that
 * you better not try to modify it. Otherwise, an {@link IllegalStateException}
 * is thrown.
