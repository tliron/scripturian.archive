<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Why does Scripturian provide its own "include" facility, and why would I prefer it over that provided by the scripting language?</h3>
<p>
You are absolutely free to use the scripting language's facilities, which in some cases could be very powerful.
Scripturian's facility offers you two advantages:
</p>
<p>
First, in that your container environment can work with specialized <a href="http://www.threecrickets.com/scripturian/api/index.html?com/threecrickets/scripturian/ScriptSource.html">ScriptSource</a> implementations.
For example, you might
want to implement a ScriptSource that reads all its scripts from a zip file. This would be great if you're using
Scipturian for enabling plugins to your application, in which case a plugin could be provided via a single zip file.
Internally, you may wants scripts to include each other. Using Scripturian's include facility, you can guarantee
that scripts can include each other no matter how the scripts are actually stored.
</p>
<p>
Second, because Scripturian allows you to mix scripting languages, it would be possible to include scripts in any language.
As to why you might want to do this, see the question below.
</p>

<h3>Why does Scripturian support mixing scriptlets in different languages in the same script?</h3>
<p>
Scripting languages differ widely in performance, capabilities, and security considerations. For example, let's say you
are using a very scalable and flexible templating language, but it does not support higher-level programming, which you need.
On the other, a higher-level language would do a poor job at the kind of templating work you need.
With Scripturian, you are able to have one scriptlet in the templating language, and others in, say, Ruby. Scripturian lets
you cleanly get the benefits of both in the same composite script.
</p>

<h3>What are "in-flow" scriptlets for?</h3>
<p>
These scriptlets are only useful in composite scripts which contain scriptlets in different languages, in which case the "in-flow" tag
lets you insert one scriptlet "into the flow" of the other. Consider this example:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;%js if(isDebug) { %&gt;
The debug information is:
&lt;%:velocity
#foreach($line in $log)
	$line.date: $line.message
#end
%&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
We are using JavaScript to do our main coding. However, we would like to use a facility in Velocity to dump our actual debug
information. Without using the in-flow tag for the Velocity scriptlet, we would be getting a JavaScript syntax error. Why?
Because Scripturian normally separates scriptlets according to scripting languages. Without the in-flow tag, it would attempt to run the first
JavaScript scriptlet, then the Velocity scriptlet, and finally the last JavaScript scriptlet. However, both JavaScript segments in this
case are incomplete and un-runnable. The in-flow tag solves this by keeping us in the flow of JavaScript, so that we are
dealing with a single JavaScript scriptlet.
</p>
<p>
How is this possible? Behind the scenes, Scripturian uses its include facility to handle in-flow scriptlets. In this case the Velocity
scriptlet is extracted into an in-memory script file. The above would then be equivalent to:
<pre>
&lt;%js if(isDebug) { %&gt;
The debug information is: &lt;%& 'dump.fragment' %&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
</pre>
<p>Where the 'dump.fragment' file is:</p>
<pre>
&lt;%:velocity
#foreach($line in $log)
	$line.date: $line.message
#end
%&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The in-flow tag saves you from creating separate files for such uses. Note that the entire separation process occurs only during
parsing, and is generally very fast. All scriptlets will be compiled for maximum performance if you request it.
Also note that parsing automatically detects cases in which you are using an "in-flow" scriptlet in the same language,
and optimizes by treating the in-flow scriptlet as a regular scriptlet.
